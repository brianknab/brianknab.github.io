I am Brian Knab. I recently completed degrees in philosophy (PhD) and in statistics (MS) at the University of Texas. At UT, I thought and wrote about philosophical problems in and around statistics.  You can read all about it [here]({{"/assets/Dissertation.pdf"}}).

In this blog, I intend to write mostly about statistics and programming -- to keep me honest in the evaluation of my own understanding. But I suspect some philosophy will arise.
