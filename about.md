I am Brian Knab. I recently completed degrees in philosophy (PhD) and in statistics (MS) at the University of Texas at Austin. At UT, I thought and wrote about philosophical problems in, around, and near the bottom of, statistics. Philosophers call this "formal epistemology."  You can read all about it [here]({{"/assets/Dissertation.pdf"}}).

In this blog, I intend to write mostly about statistics and programming -- primarily to keep me honest in the evaluation of my own understanding. I doubt it will be of much use to anyone except me. Some philosophy will probably arise.
