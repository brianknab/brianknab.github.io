					<br>
					<p>
						I am a graduate student studying philosophy (PhD) and statistics (MS) at the University of Texas at Austin.
					</p>

					<p>
						My philosophical research is in formal epistemology and the philosophy of science. In statistics, I work on Bayesian spatial autoregressive models, and their application in epidemiology.

							<div class = 'ab'> I defend origins of life research against an argument, given by Roger White in 2007, that it rests on a mistake. More generally, I show how the Bayesian machinery can illuminate the rational search for alternative explanations of improbable data.

							<br>With Cory Juhl. <i> Synthese.</i> Forthcoming.
							<div class = 'ab'>
							We argue that cosmological fine-tuning arguments are less interesting than they are thought to be. The arguments require that the laws of nature could have been other than they are. But, we argue, we have no evidence that the laws could have been other than what they are. And, we argue, such evidence may be impossible, in principle, to observe.

				<h3>Work In Progress </h3>

							<p> <b><a href = 'Significance.v15.pdf'> Probably not that improbable: on inverse probabilities and the problem of the priors. (Draft)</a></b> </p>

							<div class = 'ab'>
									<p>I offer a new response to the problem of the priors for Bayesianism. Or, at least, I offer a way of proceeding in the face of that problem -- a way to constrain the range of prior probability distributions which count as reasonable in light of our data. The idea is this: in certain situations, our data's resulting from certain prior probability distributions would entail that our epistemic lives are more exciting than they probably are. And we should, on those grounds I argue, therefore be confident that our data did not result from those distributions.</p>

							<p> <b>Evidential decision theorists should two box.<b> (Draft available upon request.) </p>

								<div class = 'ab'>
									<p>Here's a Newcomb problem: an accurate predictor has predicted whether or not you will refuse an offer of $1,000. If she predicted you <em>would</em> refuse, she deposited $1 million in your bank account. If she predicted you <em>would not</em> refuse, she did nothing. She offers you the $1,000, should you refuse it? </p>
									<p>
									In this paper, I argue that evidential decision theorists should refuse the $1,000, contra orthodoxy. This, because refusing does not provide evidence that the predictor deposited $1 million in your bank account.</p>
								</div>

							<p> <b>Of Tornadoes and 747s: In Defense of Defeatism.</b>

							<div class = 'ab'>
								<p>I defend statistical defeatism, as understood and argued against by Matt Kotzen in his "Multiple Studies and Evidential Defeat." I argue that multiple studies <i>can</i> supply evidential defeat, and that to claim otherwise is to endorse paradox.</p>
							</div>
							</p>
							<p> <b>How to be a Bayesian Curve Fitter.</b>

							<div class = 'ab'>
								<p>This paper has both a negative and a positive aim. The negative aim is to show that we cannot endorse Gordon Belot's argument, given in his "Curve Fitting for Bayesians?" without also abandoning the bulk of modern statistics.
								The positive aim is to show that the considerations advanced by Belot should nevertheless lead us to abandon countable additivity as a constraint on probabilities.</p>

					<h3>Projects</h3>
					<p> Spatial Modelling of Infectious Disease in Texas</p>
					<div class = 'ab'>
						My main aim in this project was to determine the effects of poverty and lack of infrastructure, in the South Texas colonias, on rates of 26 infectious diseases. I used Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression, with conditional autoregressive priors to account for spatial autocorrelation. The below plots show the results for one disease -- amebiasis. Both plots describe the risk ratio (that is, how many times higher the risk) of amebiasis in each Texas county. The left plot includes 95% credible intervals.
